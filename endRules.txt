painMagnitude          "mild"
tenderness             "yes"
swelling               "none"

Diagnosis
"Grade 1 MCL Sprain"
"MCL has not torn completely,
but some of the ligament fibers have been disrupted and must be repaired."

Treatment
"mild, no major surgery or rehabilitation is needed. However, the PRICE ice and 
compression method, along with the listed strength rehabilitation and cardio 
exercises, will help prevent injuries and allow you to stay fit while your knee is 
healing.

After this treatment, you can return to bearing weight on the affected knee. However, 
you should not return to the activity that caused you the injury until you have a 
painless, normal range of motion and you feel that 90% of your normal strength is 
recovered."

Diagnosis
"Grade 2 MCL Sprain"
"MCL has experienced a major rupture, 
but has not torn completely and can be easily repaired through 
many of the same treatments as a Grade 1 MCL injury."

Treatment
"moderately severe, braces and crutches, along with extensive rehabilitation in the
knee,should be used to encourage stability in the knee joint and prevent further
sprains. Some guidelines to this treatment include:

   1: If you walk with a limp, use crutches until you can bear weight on your 
      affected knee.
   2: A brace should be used in all activities to prevent further injuries, even when  
      not using crutches.
   3: Avoidance of exercises that involve rotational movements such as soccer and 
      football. Instead, use cardio exercises that are mentioned later on.

Ideally, this type of sprain will heal within four to six weeks. Maintaining this
treatment on a daily basis will shorten recovery time, but only return to activity
after you feel that 90% of your normal strength is recovered, and you have a
painless, normal range of motion."

Diagnosis
"Grade 3 MCL Sprain"
"MCL has completely ruptured, and the ligament fibers have completely torn."

Treatment
"very severe, a visit to a physician is highly, highly recommended. Do NOT put
pressure on your knee or attempt to walk, since this action will put more stress on
the other ligaments and bones in the area.

Because of the severity of this injury, please see a physician immediately for an
accurate diagnosis. For a ligament tear, reconstructive surgery may be needed.

With proper treatment and constant, extensive rehabilitation, expected recovery time
is within two to four months. After recovery, a knee brace should be used to
stabilize the knee and help prevent further injuries."

Treatment
"mild or moderate, no extensive surgery will be needed. You should see a physician to
assess how much of your LCL is torn, but the treatment for both grades of sprains
similar, only differing in recovery time. You should also ask your physician for an
X-ray, in case any loose bodies such as bone fragments are floating around the area.


Some guidelines to treating an LCL injury:
   1: If you walk with a limp, use crutches until you can bear weight on your 
      affected knee.
   2: A brace should be used in all activities to prevent further injuries, even when 
      not using crutches.
   3: Avoidance of exercises that involve rotational movements such as soccer and 
      football. Instead, use cardio and strength exercises that are mentioned later

instability            "yes"

Diagnosis
"Grade 3 PCL Sprain"
"the ligament fibers in your PCL have been completely torn."

Treatment
"severe, extensive rehabilitation and treatment are needed for a full recovery. 
However, there is some controversy over the treatment of Grade 3 tears. One accepted 
method involves immobilization with crutches for six weeks, followed by range of 
motion exercises, then strength exercises by four months.

Theoretically, an athlete can still play with a torn PCL, but there is too much of a 
risk, because there is no ligament preventing the knee from bending towards the 
front, against the knee cap. Obviously, this hyperextension would cause massive 
problems.

See a physician for more accurate information on how to proceed."

"ACL has torn, but you will need to see a physician for an accurate diagnosis."

Treatment
"very severe, a visit to a physician is highly, highly recommended.
While you may still be able to walk, take as much pressure off your knee as possible 
to prevent other injuries.

Because the method to treat an ACL injury is disputed, please see a licensed 
physician to treat the injury. Treatment can include:
                
1: Surgery to reconstruct the knee joint to replace support from tearing your ACL
2: Wearing a brace for 3 to 5 weeks to stabilize the knee
3: 4 to 6 months of rehabilitation with a physical trainer to strengthen muscles 
around the knee

You may have to use a knee brace after rehabilitation, but please consult a physician 
to more accurately treat your injury."

Diagnosis
"Patellar Subluxation"
"your kneecap moved temporarily from its normal position, but has returned."

Treatment
"mildly severe, you may only require an examination of your knee by a physician to 
test stability. More likely, you will need to have an X-ray to examine for loose 
bodies in the knee that may have dislodged with a violent action such as a 
dislocating kneecap.

While you may be able to continue participating in physical activity immediately, it 
is recommended that you see a physician, do strength rehabilitation exercises, and 
rest from the activity for one to two weeks to allow bones and ligaments to heal, if 
they have been mildly injured."

Diagnosis
"Patellar Dislocation"
"your kneecap has dislodged from its normal position and is still outside its 
groove."
   
Treatment
"very severe, you will need to see a physician who can address this situation. DO NOT 
MOVE THE KNEE, and do not attempt to push your kneecap back into the groove yourself. 
Place ice carefully around the knee, but do not compress the knee.
   
Once your kneecap is back in place, you should immobilize the knee and use crutches 
for four to six weeks. After, you will want to wear a knee brace to encourage 
stability around the knee, and use strength rehabilitation exercises to strengthen 
the area, so that the displacement does not happen again."

"your kneecap has fractured, but it has not dislodged and stayed in the same 
position."   

Treatment
"severe, you will need to see a physician who will X-ray your knee, and will assist 
you with splinting and immobilizing the knee. You should use the PRICE method for ice 
and compression, mentioned below.
   
With proper immobilization and icing, your knee should heal within 2 to 3 months."

"the bursae, which are fluid-filled sacs that separate parts of your knee from 
rubbing and locking, have become inflammed."   

Treatment
"moderately severe, you should stop the activity until your knee has stopped swelling 
and you can extend and bend your knee without any pain. You should use the PRICE 
method for ice and compression, mentioned below.

If swelling does not subsist after two to three days, you should see a physician who 
will more accurately diagnose the injury. You can also take anti-inflammatories that 
can lessen the pain, such as Ibuprofen."

"Tendonitis, or Jumper's Knee"
"the tendons around your kneecap have become inflammed from overuse."   

Treatment
"mildly to moderately severe, you should stop the activity until your knee is not 
tender and no swelling is prevalent. You should use the PRICE method for ice and 
compression, mentioned below. However, you should not have to see your doctor unless 
the problem occurs again. With proper icing, you should be able to recover within one 
to two weeks. In the meantime, you can continue to participate in less strenuous 
activities while taking anti-inflammatories such as Ibuprofen."

visibleDifferences   "muscle atrophy"

Diagnosis
"meniscus tear"
"cartilage that facilitates movement in your knee has torn."

Treatment
"moderately severe, you should compress and ice the area immediately and see a 
physician. If you cannot move your knee at all, DO NOT move the knee, and have 
somebody help you to the physician, since you will need to be under anasthesia before 
a knee should be unlocked.

If the knee is not locked, however, it can be treated similarly to a Grade 1 or 2 
ligament sprain. This diagnosis means that you should use the PRICE icing method and 
use strength rehabilitation exercises to strengthen knee muscles to prevent further 
tears from twisting."

Diagnosis
"joint contusions"
"you have experience a direct force on your bones and/or muscles that have created 
tenderness and bruising, and can cause pain when flexing and extending your knee."

Treatment
"mild, you should use the PRICE method for icing and compressing the area until the 
pain subsides, and continue icing periodically for the next three days if swelling 
continues. Once the swelling subsides, the athlete can return to their activity, but 
should wear padding around the bruised area and use PRICE on the area after each 
session.

You should heal within a few days, and should not have to see a physician. However, 
if the swelling does not subside after a week, then it could actually be bursitis or 
synovitis, which need medical attention."

Diagnosis
"Chondromalacia Patella"
"the cartilage below your kneecap has softened, causing your kneecap to grind against 
other bones."

Treatment
"severe, you should see a physician about this condition. Your cartilage is failing, 
causing disruption in the movement of your knee, and will continue to hurt when 
walking up stairs, jumping, or participating in a sport that involves repetitive knee 
movements.

You will need to get an X-ray, and surgery will be needed to replace or reconstruct 
cartilage."
